GISTIC2.0 facilitates sensitive and confident localization of the targets of focal somatic copy-number alteration in human cancers (PMID: 21527027)

The Gistic has many outputs such as txt files,pdf,mat etc. The txt files A) all_lesions.conf_75.txt B)amp_genes.conf_75.txt  C)del_genes.conf_75.txt are primarly used to
process the information for downstream analysis.

Gistic is run by following command on linux enviroment: 
module load matlab
## output directory
outDir=/home/x/y/Patient1_results/
mkdir -p $outDir 

segFile=Patinet1.txt #copy number data
refGeneFile=hg19.mat

## call script that sets MCR environment and calls GISTIC executable 
bsub -J Gistic -q compbio -e stderr.err -o stdout.out -R rusage[mem=2000] "./gistic2 -b $outDir -seg $segFile  -refgene $refGeneFile"


Te Gistic results file has many outputs including A) all_lesions.conf_75.txt B)amp_genes.conf_75.txt  C)del_genes.conf_75.txt. These files are inputs for
our analysis.

The driver genes are specific for cancer types.

There are three patients in our sample analysis. Each patient have many tumor samples that are to be analyzed. 


The final output files  are Patient1_amp_del_focal_driver_combined.xlsx, Patient2_amp_del_focal_driver_combined.xlsx and Patient3_amp_del_focal_driver_combined.xlsx
